            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a software engineer that is now focusing on learning web development. I have worked with embbedded <br>software,
                AOSP middleware configuration, and most recently, iOS app development. Having worked on <br>front-end applications,
                I realized that I also want to learn more about the backend, rounding my experience <br>as a full-stack developer with a focus,
                on backend development.
